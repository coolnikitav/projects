## Design and Verification
- Controller:
  - Design: [controller.v](https://github.com/coolnikitav/nikitas-notebook/blob/main/engineering/lc3-controller-project1/controller/controller.v)
  - Testbench: [controller_tb.sv](https://github.com/coolnikitav/nikitas-notebook/blob/main/engineering/lc3-controller-project1/controller/controller_tb.sv)
  - Simulation output: [controller_simulation_output.md](https://github.com/coolnikitav/nikitas-notebook/blob/main/engineering/lc3-controller-project1/controller/controller_simulation_output.md)
  - Simulation waveforms: [controller_tb_waveform](https://github.com/coolnikitav/nikitas-notebook/blob/main/engineering/lc3-controller-project1/controller/controller_tb_waveform.md)

## LC3 Behavior
- This project addresses ALU (ADD, NOT, AND) and Memory (LEA) operations. All of these instructions take 5 clock cycles
- LC3 is unpipelined. Each instruction goes through 5 cycles: Fetch -> Decode -> Execute -> Writeback -> UpdatePC
- This project does not address typical pipeline issues like control and data dependence
- The purpose of this controller is to correctly fill the 8 registers in the writeback module. They will be checked during verification.

## Instruction Memory
- The instructions are stored, starting at address 3000
- Address 16'h3000 is 16'b0011_0000_0000_0000. Thus, 16 bits will be used for instruction memory.
- The first 4 instructions are taken from the project example
  - @3000: 5020 (AND R0 R0 #0)
  - @3001: 1422 (ADD R2 R0 #2)
  - @3002: 1820 (ADD R1 R2 R0)
  - @3003: EC03 (LEA R6 #-2)
- Instructions 16'h3004-16'h4095 will be filled up with randomized AND, ADD, NOT, LEA operations.
